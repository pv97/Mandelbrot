        The core series being investigated is is z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c where z and c are complex numbers.
        The graph displayed lies on the complex plane of a+bi, which represents the values of c choosen for the series.
        We are interested in how fast the series z<sub>n</sub> diverges with chosen initial z<sub>0</sub> and c, so we color the
        graph with white representing no divergence and black representing rapid divergence.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The default set being displayed is the Mandelbrot set, where z<sub>0</sub> is set to be 0. Thus the Mandlebrot set is a 2D
        representation of a 3D fractal surface.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A related collection of sets are the Julia sets, of which is generated by instead testing the covergence of a fixed c, with
        varying z values from the complex plane. Thus the Mandlebrot set is the intersection at the origin on the complex plane with
        the Julia sets following the series <br/> z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        To truly appeciate the duality of these two sets, this tool is created to explore the various Mandlebrot sets for different
        initial z values, allowing, albeit gradual, exploration of the 5D fractal surface of the divergence of this beautiful series.
